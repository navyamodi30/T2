🔍 Exploring Data through EDA 🔍

As part of my internship, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets like the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This involved identifying patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

From handling missing data to creating impactful visualizations, this task reinforced the importance of preparing and analyzing data before diving into complex models. EDA is the foundation of effective data science, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring and understanding datasets.
